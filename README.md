# Make Interactive Ratings


# Challenge Description
In this challenge, letâ€™s continue development on the Movie Rating App. Instead of the rating stars being for display purposes only, 
letâ€™s transform them into clickable buttons that allow end users to provide their own rating.

## Requirements
- Remove the display-only stars that we coded in the last challenge
- Create buttons for each rating from 1 to 5 and display a star inside.
- Color the stars based on the movie rating. For example, if the movie rating is 3, color 3 stars yellow and 2 gray.
- Allow the end user to click on any of the 5 buttons to update the movie rating accordingly.
- Disable the button for the currently selected rating to prevent the user from giving the same rating twice.

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

# Improve the Rating UX

# Challenge Description

In this challenge, letâ€™s present each movieâ€™s ratings prominently with a big star and the rating number in the top right hand corner of the movie poster.

## Requirements

- Display each movie rating number within a large yellow `StarIcon` in the top right hand corner of the movie posters
- For movies with no rating, show a dash (-) instead of the number and color the `StarIcon` gray

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: You can use the tailwind classes `text-yellow-500` and `text-gray-500` to help color the star
>
> ðŸ’¡ HINT: You can give the movie rating a null value in movies.json to test the proper display of a movie with no rating

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

### Example of Finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
